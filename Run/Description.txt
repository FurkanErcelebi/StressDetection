
Experiment environment setup in Google Colab system. You hate must run on colab and upload dataset in specific folder you want

Some variable fecth from environment. There must be '.env' file in root folder of drive and folloeing environment varibles must assigned:

MAIN_EXP_PATH -> direcory path where AKTIVES dataset located.
EXPR_RESULT_PATH -> direcory path for saving trainng results and test datasets.
UTIL_SCRIPT_PATH -> direcory path where notebooks and other util scripts located.

For preparing datasets in order of preprocess , augmentation and feature extraction , execute notebooks for following order :

- PreprocessPhysiologicalSignalsForST.ipynb
- PreprocessPhysiologicalSignalsForEDA.ipynb
- PreprocessPhysiologicalSignalsForBVP.ipynb
- AugmentationOfPreprocessedPhysiologicalSignals.ipynb
- ExtractFeaturesFromPhysiologicalSignalsForST.ipynb
- ExtractFeaturesFromPhysiologicalSignalsForEDA.ipynb
- ExtractFeaturesFromPhysiologicalSignalsForBVP.ipynb
- AnalyzeFeaturesOfPhysiologicalSignals.ipynb

'AlexNet Stress Detection {Augmentation_Status} And {Dataset_Status} Datasets For {Procedure_Codes}.ipynb' and 
'LSTM Stress Detection {Augmentation_Status} And {Dataset_Status} Datasets For {Procedure_Codes}.ipynb' notebooks are for model training.
Paranthesis enclosed tags are for specified what trainig and dataset fromats will be used. These meanings described below:

Augmentation_Status -> Decide whether augmentation samples willbe used in training . Ä°f used , fill as '__Seperated_Augmentation'. Otherwise remain in empty

Dataset_Status -> Decide whether class category distribution No Stress / Stress rates as balanced 
					If balaced , write 'Balanced'. Otherwise 'Non Balanced'

Procedure_Codes -> Dataset procedure code combination found in location which assigned in MAIN_EXP_PATH variable. All dataset starts with 'all_feature_metrics_dataset-non_balanced-'
					and procedure codes . Must writed in notebook name for using specific dataset. for example 'all_feature_metrics_dataset-non_balanced-DP_2--AP_9--FP_2'

Also ,to  train different version of LSTM , LSTM_VERSION_NO variable in 'LSTM Stress Detection {Augmentation_Status} And {Dataset_Status} Datasets For {Procedure_Codes}.ipynb' 
notebook must be changed.

After one of running all cells of one of notebooks , you can analyze training process logs and test results in 'AnalyzeExperimentResults.ipynb'
notebook.
